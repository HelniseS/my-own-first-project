## Wireframes

Wireframes were designed using Balsamiq tool. Following best practices, mobile version was designed first, then tablet and lastly the laptop view. There are some deviations from wireframes in the live version of the quiz. It is one page website to enhance the logical flow. I have added level user selected in the question view, a number of correct and wrong answers as well. A functionality of local storage to display top 5 results is included in the final version as well.

# Testing

## Bugs

During development and testing, several issues were identified and resolved to improve the website's accessibility, HTML structure, and overall performance.

### Testing Tools Used
- **WAVE Accessibility Tool**
- **W3C HTML Validator**
- **Google Lighthouse**

### Summary of Issues

| Issue Type            | Description                                                                 | Tool Used     | Fix Status       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Contrast Errors       | Very low contrast (e.g. 1.1:1) between text and background.                 | WAVE          |  Updated colors |
| Missing `<h1>`        | No top-level heading was detected on the main page.                         | WAVE          |  Added `<h1>`   |
| Unclosed Tags         | Multiple unclosed elements: `<form>`, `<section>`, `<div>`, and `<body>`.   | W3C Validator |  Fixed structure|
| Stray Closing Tag     | Extra closing `</form>` tag found.                                          | W3C Validator |  Removed        |
| Skipped Heading Level | Heading structure was inconsistent, skipping from `<h1>` to `<h3>`.         | WAVE          |  Reorganized    |
| Suspicious Alt Text   | Some images had missing or unclear `alt` attributes.                        | WAVE          |  Added proper alt|
| Link to Word Document | Linking directly to a downloadable `.docx` file raised accessibility flag. | WAVE          |  Added label    |
| Large Image Size      | Hero image not optimized—recommended savings of 250+ KiB.                   | Lighthouse    | Optimized file |

###  Notes
- All HTML structure errors were corrected to ensure proper nesting and closing of tags.
- Accessibility scores improved significantly after fixing contrast and heading issues.
- A smaller image in WebP format was used to enhance loading performance.
